# MetroMaster
Path finder and Fare Calculator
## Features
Implement Heap Data Structure, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, breadth-first search, and depth-first search algorithms for shortest path and fare calculation.
## Project Description
MetroMaster is a comprehensive toolkit designed to facilitate efficient navigation and fare calculation within a metro transit system. The project includes implementations of essential graph algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS), along with a custom Min-Heap data structure to support these algorithms. By leveraging these algorithms, MetroMaster provides both the shortest path and fare calculations between metro stations.
